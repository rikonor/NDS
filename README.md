NDS - Networked Dyanmic Systems

This python library is used to model and simulate networks represented by graphs.

In it's current form it served me as mostly an excercise as well as a learning tool for Python and math concepts such as graph-theory, control-systems and linear algebra.

The networks are composed of graphs, where each graph itself is composed of
-- Nodes and 
-- Edges.
